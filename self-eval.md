# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
Pretty tough, not easy to get through and I did not answer everything 100%. I can see the concepts and talking out loud helps but not everything is clicking yet. Hopefully with more practice and instruction this will become easier
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
Going alright, I have found myself working 5-7 hours of school on top of a full time job so I'm very tired. I have been good about taking breaks and jumping right back into the work. 
- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?
Read through everything several times before starting and make sure I understand everything as well as I can. Save all your good resources!
